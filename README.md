# Aero Mobility Social Media Links

## Deployed Page
[AeroMobility Links Page](https://aeromobility.github.io/links/)

##About
This is to add a central hub of all the Social Media Links for 
Aero Mobility, and GiantMobility. Both Companies are Rendered seperately in order to prevent clutter of a bunch of links in one place.
This is a very barebones site, since it's not updateable online. All must be done through the code.

## Technology

Used React as the framework. Runs in GitHub Pages.

## Future Updates

- Adding the ability to update links on page.
- Add a page for some videos suggested by team for customers to be able do self maintenance.
